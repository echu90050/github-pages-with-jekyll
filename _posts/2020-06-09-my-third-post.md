My third accomplishment wouuld be becoming a 2020 College Prep Scholar. I am proud of this accomplishment because because I worked on  
the application everyday for a month until the deadline. In addition, there were 3,779 students that were selected from a least 12,600
students to be a Colleg Prep Scholar. Completing this application also gave me experience on what college applications are like and the
process since it requires me to fill out personal information, complete a 650-word essay, and a few short answers. Both the essay and 
short answers allowed me to reflect on my accomplishments, hardships, and my growth as a student and individual. Furthermore, I made new
friends along the way, whether they were also a College Prep Scholar this year or from last year.
