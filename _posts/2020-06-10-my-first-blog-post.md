My second accomplishment during high school would be stepping out of my comfort zone and doing things that make me feel uncomfortable. 
I gradually did more and more activities that I would not do on a daily basis and it was beneficial since I became more confident and took
more risks, which allowed me to not regret not doing certain things as well as experience things that I would not have been able to if I 
chose to stay in my comfort zone. For example, towards the end of my sophomore year, I ran for exec board positions for two clubs
and had to speak in front of the clubs, which consisted of about 100 to 150 members. Although I did not like public speaking, I did it because
it helped me become more comfortable with myself and also gave me the opportunity to be a part of two exec boards and gain leadership experience.
