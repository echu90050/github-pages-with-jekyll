My second accomplishment during high school would be taking initiative on certain topics/activities I am passionate about rather than waiting
for someone else to start something. For example, for Pre-Med club, I helped plan the first club field trip. It was definitely a spontaneous idea 
at the beginning of the year, but with effort and time, we planned a trip at the end of February, where we went to the Mutter Museum. I made new 
friends on the trip, learned more about biology, anatomy, and immunology. Also, another time I took initiative would be starting my Mental Health 
Awareness Passion Project by myself. At first, it was also a spontaneous thought, but with encouragement from peers, personal experience, and the 
desire to make an impact, I started the project and started gaining support from parents within the community, strangers, and even the local Girl 
Scouts. I would consider this an accomplishment because I tend to follow rather than lead usually. By taking initiative, I learned how it is to be
a leader and get things done.
